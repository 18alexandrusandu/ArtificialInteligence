Minefield is a game played on an 8x8 board. You start in the upper left corner and you navigate the board <br>
using the arrow keys. Your current location is indicated in green. Some cells contain mines; some contain <br>
messages, others are empty.  If you move into a cell containing a mine, the game immediately ends. If you <br>
move into a cell containing a message,the message appears in the message area above the board. The  <br>
message 
can help you locate mines. The messages are written in natural language. Even though the messages <br> 
are in natural language your trustfully helper mace4 will receive messages in a relational logic language and  <br>
it will inform you what cells to avoid. In order to win you need to visit all cells that do not contain a bomb. <br>
